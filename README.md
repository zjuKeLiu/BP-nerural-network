# BP-nerural-network
A simple neural network used to approximating function in C and MATLAB language.

1.file list
  
  "MLP1\_sin.m": wirtten in matlab, used to approximate sine function in batch mode.
  
  "sequ1.cpp": written in C language, used to approximate sine function in sequencial mode
  
  "plotpic.m": written in matlab, used to plot the data in text files which are generated by the program sequ1
  
  "sequ2.cpp": written in C language, used to approximate the bivariate function  "plotpicture.m": written in matlab, used to plot the data in text files which are generated by the program sequ2
  
  "Report\_Liuke.pdf": report of this project

2.run the files
  
  (1)If you want to run my C code in VS, please make the stack bigger.
  
  (2)After C files has been run, please move the .txt files to the same folder with plotpic.m or plotpicture.m, if you want to plot the picture.
